ROI
Testing a process
2:07.41 - Without dummy date (127 seconds)
1:37.96 - With dummy data (97 seconds)

We save 30 seconds per test

If we do 5 tests a day that is 150 seconds saved
We work 5 days a week, that is 750 seconds saved a week
52 weeks in a year would give us 39,000 seconds saved a year. That is 650 minutes or roughly 11 hours.
