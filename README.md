# NBS-Dummy-Data
This is a web app for National Benefit Services that holds dummy data for testing AWD forms. The user can copy and paste dummy data from the site and into AWD.
The user will be able to change the theme of the page and dummy data at the click of a button.

Ideas:
- We can have a Harry Potter theme.
