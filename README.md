# NBS-Dummy-Data
This is a web app for National Benefit Services that holds dummy data for testing AWD forms. The user can copy and paste dummy data from the site and into AWD.
The user will be able to change the theme of the page and dummy data at the click of a button.

Ideas:
- We can have a Harry Potter theme.
- We can have a DC theme
- We can have a marvel theme
- We can have a star wars theme
- Have the NBS logo in the top left corner. Have buttons to change the theme at the bottom of the page.
- Have a mobile version that makes copying data from the site easy. For example, the user can drag the page to make it smaller and have it in the corner of the screen.
- In the menu screen, have a button the user can click to resize the screen. That way, they can make the screen smaller at the click of a button. https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/

- In the dropdown menu, include checkboxes for filters. The user can filter for the type of data they need: correctly formatted, incorrectly formatted, social security numbers, phone numbers, etc.
- Have a Halloween theme. Change the crest out for a pumpkin. The entity names will be scary movie characters.
- It would also be cool if I could link data to hotkeys. 
- The filters could be stored in JavaScript memory.
