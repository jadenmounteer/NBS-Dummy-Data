# NBS-Dummy-Data
This is a web app for National Benefit Services that holds dummy data for testing AWD forms. The user can copy and paste dummy data from the site and into AWD.
The user will be able to change the theme of the page and dummy data at the click of a button.

Ideas:
- We can have a Harry Potter theme.
- We can have a DC theme
- We can have a marvel theme
- We can have a star wars theme
- Have the NBS logo in the top left corner. Have buttons to change the theme at the bottom of the page.
- Have a mobile version that makes copying data from the site easy. For example, the user can drag the page to make it smaller and have it in the corner of the screen.

How to access the page:
